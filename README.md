# exaltered-nirvana-computing
Simple Python3 script for computing Nirvana values, used during the Naa'Maz Nirvana computations.
In other words, given a dice roll ndk (where n is the number of dice and k the sides for each die, e.g. 3d6 for a roll of 3 dice with 6 sides) and a probability p, it outputs the value d such that p % of the dice rolls go above said value.
